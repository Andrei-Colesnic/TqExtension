# Migration from 1.x to 2.x versions

Any Behat configuration of 1.x version will not work with 2.x version and on the contrary. Also,
the 1.x version will no longer maintained.

- Make sure that the **behat.yml** in your project has the similar [structure](/behat/behat.yml).
- Check your ***.feature** files for nonexistent steps.

## Removed steps

```gherkin
When I press ".link" element
```

```gherkin
Then I press on element with text "Account"(| in "footer" region)
```

they are must replaced by:

```gherkin
## In role of element selector can be:
## - CSS selector;
## - Inaccurate text;
## - Region name from "behat.yml";
When I press|click|double click|right click on ".link"
```

For click on element in a region combine the two steps:

```gherkin
Then I work with elements in "header" region
And click on "Main menu"
```
